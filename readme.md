Hi, I am Rahul Sahay. I'm Microsoft MVP specializing in Web technologies.  I am technical fellow at Kongsberg Digital. I have been working in various aspects of the software development life cycle for 12+ years, focusing on web
stack development. I have been part of software development in different applications, ranging from client applications to web services to websites.I am also involved in designing application architecture from scratch. Most of the time 
spend writing platform agnostic, cloud agnostic code.  As a code junkie, I love to craft software, not only I enjoy writing software.
